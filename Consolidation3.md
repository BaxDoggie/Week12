Consolidation 3 

This week pushed me to think more deeply about what it actually means to revisit and strengthen work in digital archaeology. Earlier in the course, especially in Module 2, I was mainly excited about the tools themselves machine learning classifiers, neural networks, and AI agents. But returning to one of those projects and doing it over showed me that digital archaeology isn’t just a toolkit. It’s a way of thinking. It changes how questions are asked, what counts as evidence, and how results are interpreted. In some ways, it reminds me of cognitive science, it exists at the intersection of many fields, and because of that, it creates its own perspective rather than simply borrowing one. 

Redoing My Work 

The work I chose to revisit was the Roman coin image classifier. In Module 2, I built a machine-learning classifier by gathering images, preparing a dataset, and training a model to identify different types of Roman coins. I also experimented with an AI agent trained on the writings of a historical figure, which helped me understand how text-based models respond to patterns in data. Together those projects were some of the most fascinating parts of the course so far. 

For this reflection, I decided to redo the coin classifier and dig deeper into the training process. I expanded the dataset, improved the consistency of the images, and spent more time fine-tuning the model. The biggest change was realizing how sensitive the classifier is to the quality and size of the dataset. Small adjustments had a noticeable impact on accuracy. Doing it again helped me understand the difference between “the model didn’t work well” and “the dataset wasn’t strong enough.” Even if it wasn’t the flashiest project, it became one of the clearest examples of how digital tools can meaningfully support archaeological work when used carefully. 

The more I worked on it, the more I could see how classifiers offer archaeologists a practical way to categorize, sort, and analyze large sets of visual material. At the same time, revisiting the workflow made it very obvious that these tools don’t replace experts they help them, but only if the human side of the process is solid. 

Reproducing vs. Replicating 

This redo helped me understand the difference between reproducing and replicating in a way I didn’t fully appreciate before. To me, reproducing something feels like following a recipe, if someone has documented their steps clearly and you have the same data, you should be able to get the same result. It’s essential to the field because it lets us verify whether earlier work actually holds up. 

Replication, on the other hand, means following the same methods but adapting or extending them applying the approach to a new dataset, changing the parameters, or exploring what happens when something is altered. Replication is where we learn what a method can really do. It’s not about checking someone’s work; it’s about pushing it further. That distinction feels especially important in digital archaeology because so much of the field depends on transparent workflows, shared code, and clearly documented data choices. 

How My Thinking Has Evolved Since Module 2 

My understanding of digital archaeology has shifted a lot since finishing Module 2. At the start of the course, I had the impression that digital archaeology was mostly a big collection of tools for coding, machine learning, mapping, simulations, and so on. But now I see that treating it that way misses the point entirely. 

Digital archaeology isn’t just adding new tools to archaeology. It brings a different way of looking at archaeological questions, and that perspective comes from combining things like computing, data science, visualization, simulation, and traditional archaeological reasoning. It’s a hybrid field, and because of that, it offers insights that wouldn’t exist if each part were kept separate. 

Working more deeply with the classifier and the AI agent reinforced that the “digital” part isn’t superficial it changes how we think about data, patterns, interpretation, and even uncertainty. I’ve started appreciating how much digital archaeology asks us to think about what we’re doing, rather than just how to do it. 

New Dilemmas 

Revisiting these projects also made me more aware of some dilemmas in the field. 

One ethical issue involves the AI agent. While it’s interesting to see how an agent trained on a person’s written works responds, it’s crucial to remember that none of its output should ever be taken as something the person would or did say. It can imitate patterns, but it cannot represent thoughts or intentions. There’s a real risk of people forgetting that distinction, especially when the model feels convincing. 

Another dilemma is the reliability of classifiers. They’re incredibly useful tools, but they shouldn’t be trusted too much. A model can confidently make a wrong prediction, and without understanding the dataset and the limits of the method, it’s very easy to overinterpret the results. This raises questions about how archaeologists should balance computational findings with expert judgment, and how transparent we need to be when communicating these results to different audiences. 

These dilemmas make it clear that digital archaeology isn’t just about technical skill; it involves careful ethical and interpretive thinking as well. 

Conclusion 

Redoing my earlier work and reflecting on the differences between reproduction and replication helped me see digital archaeology in a fuller, more mature way. The tools I used classifiers, AI agents, simulations were interesting on their own, but the real learning came from understanding how they shape questions, influence interpretation, and require careful ethical consideration. I’m leaving this week with a clearer sense that digital archaeology isn’t a side branch of archaeology or just a set of technical tricks. It’s a perspective that blends multiple ways of thinking and demands both creativity and responsibility. I want to carry forward this awareness that strong digital archaeological work depends not only on skillful use of tools, but also on being transparent, critical, and intentional about how those tools guide our insights into the past.
